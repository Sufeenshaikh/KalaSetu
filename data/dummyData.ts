    bio: 'A master of block printing, carrying on a family tradition.',
    story: `From the moment I could walk, the scent of indigo and the rhythmic 'thump-thump' of wooden blocks on fabric was my world. I grew up in a small village in Rajasthan, watching my grandmother, her hands stained with the colors of the earth, bring plain cotton to life. She would tell me that each block held a storyâ€”the peacock for beauty, the elephant for strength, the lotus for purity. She didn't just teach me a craft; she passed down a language.

Today, my own hands carry on that tradition. I mix my own dyes from turmeric, madder root, and pomegranate peel, just as she did. The process is slow, meditative. It requires patience and a deep respect for the materials. When I press a freshly carved block onto the fabric, I feel a connection to the generations of women before me who did the same. It's more than just making a pattern; it's about embedding a piece of our history, our soul, into the cloth.

Through my work, I want to share the vibrancy and spirit of Rajasthan with the world. Each scarf, each tapestry, is not just an item to be worn or displayed. It is a piece of my heart, a testament to a legacy that I am proud to carry forward. It is the story of my village, my family, and the enduring beauty of handmade art.`,
