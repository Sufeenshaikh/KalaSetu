            <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Millions of artisans in India are keepers of centuries-old traditions, creating breathtaking works of art. However, many face significant barriers, including limited market access, unfair wages, and a lack of resources to tell their stories. This disconnect threatens not only their livelihoods but the survival of their precious cultural heritage.
